# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  


# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __RSVP feature__ which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. __Receive email alerts__ when someone RSVPs.
4. A nice __Youtube video__ showing venue.
5. __Google Maps__ showing your venue's location.
6. __Email feed forward__ allowing guests to send requests or telegrams.
7. Start and run the website __completely free__. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can use
   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and Google sheets (with the help of Google scripts) to store RSVP
   data.
